# VinVentory
Inventory for small business that sells vinyl decals and stickers.
This program makes a lot of assumptions of what products are offered and how they are organized. It also assumes you're an Etsy seller. It is currently a work in progress with a lot of progress left to go.

I have learned a lot during this project, but I have probably done a number of things inefficiently or incoherently. Please let me know if you see either of those issues.
